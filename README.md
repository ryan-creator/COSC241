# COSC241
In COSC241 we learn more advanced programming ideas, such as recursion and abstract data type design, are introduced, as well as their implementations in Java. A variety of different data structures are discussed together with the algorithms to query and modify them. Theoretical and practical analyses of efficiency are used throughout the paper.
